# Rock–Paper–Scissors Game – Sprint #1

**Duration:** 1 Week  
**Sprint Goal:** Build a functional, visually appealing Rock–Paper–Scissors browser game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **GitHub Copilot** as an AI-assisted coding tool.  
The project follows structured development practices, version control workflows, and aims to deliver a polished, bug-free product.

## 📌 1. Project Scope

### Objective
Design and develop an interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game that:

- Allows the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Randomly generates the computer’s choice.
- Displays the result (win, lose, or draw) for each round with visual feedback.
- Tracks and displays scores for both player and computer.
- Limits the game to 5 rounds, then declares a winner or tie.
- Includes a Replay option.
- Features a clean, responsive UI for both desktop and mobile.

**Inclusions:**
- Game logic: rules, scoring, win/lose conditions.
- Responsive design with consistent styling.
- Animations & visual effects for results and button interactions.
- Documentation: README, code walkthrough, and Copilot prompt log.

**Exclusions:**
- Multiplayer support (online or local).
- Backend/server-side logic (entirely client-side).
